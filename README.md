## Tech Stack

The project leverages a combination of standard web technologies and popular libraries to deliver a modern and interactive user experience.

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content of the web pages.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and visual design. (Note: The `style.css` content is unusually embedded within a `<script>` tag in the `<body>` in the provided sample; best practice is to link it externally or embed it in `<head>`.)
*   **JavaScript:** For dynamic behavior, interactivity, and integration with libraries. (Linked `app.js` is present but its content was not provided).
*   **Bootstrap 5.3.3:** Frontend component library for responsive design and pre-built UI components (Navbar, Cards, Accordion, Grid System).
*   **Font Awesome 6.1.1:** Icon library for scalable vector icons.
*   **Bootstrap Icons:** Additional icon set for a wider range of glyphs.
*   **Swiper.js:** Modern touch slider for creating the client logos carousel and customer testimonials.
*   **Animate.css 4.1.1:** A cross-browser library of CSS animations for various elements.

## API / Endpoints

This project is a purely static frontend website and does not interact with any backend APIs or custom endpoints. All content is served directly from the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

It does, however, integrate with external services via direct links:
*   **WhatsApp:** `wa.me` links for booking appointments and chatting.
*   **Phone:** `tel:` links for direct phone calls.
*   **Email:** `mailto:` links for sending emails.
